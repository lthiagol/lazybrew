# State — the resume record

One row per slice. This file is the resume record: a cold session reads it to
learn what is done, what is in flight, and where to pick up.

| slice | commits | state | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| detach-master-plan | 3a770a7, b95af56, 7428739, 3431b9d, 180d398 | implemented | awaiting reviewer |

**How a cold session resumes work.** Read `work/briefs/<slice>.md` for the
contract of the slice in the row above, then read the receipts in `work/inbox/`
for that slice — the receipt is the record of what was actually done and what the
evidence was. The `commits` column tells you which commits to inspect, in AC
order. If a lane reported a blocker, it is named in the receipt and the
corresponding question (if any) is in `work/questions.md`. If the state is
`implementing` but the receipt is missing, the lane died mid-slice: re-read the
brief, check `git log`, and redo only the criteria without a commit. Do not
re-derive the plan from anywhere else — the brief is the contract, and
`master-plan/` is a frozen, untracked, local-only archive that is not an input to
any decision.
